So what you need to do:  

1.  Create GitHub repo with source code and provide us a link. Deploy your page on github pages or surge - will be a great plus.  

2.  Create responsive markup from the PSD sketch (available by this link - https://www.dropbox.com/s/psx6yl23kba1ooh/easy-sketch.psd?dl=0)  

3.  In the section “Skills” all list items should be generated from provided array with following structure:  

[  

{ name: "HTML5", level: 8},

{ name: "CSS3", level: 5},  

{ name: "JavaScript", level: 10},

{ name: "ReactJS", level: 8 },  

{ name: "AngularJS", level: 8 },

]  

4.  In the section “Contact” you need to add actions to form inputs and show in the browser console entered value.  

Will be a plus using any CSS preprocessors (SASS/ Less).  Have fun and learn something new!
